# Ludo-Python-game-
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four[a] players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die.

I created this game back in 2016 during my third semester for my Computational Thinking 2 course. I created the game in Python using it's tkint graphics library.
